# Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean

Bumbling, childlike Mr. Bean (ingeniously played by Rowan Atkinson) has trouble completing the simplest of tasks in day-to-day life, but his perseverance and resourcefulness frequently allow him to find unusual (and often absurd) ways around problems. He's almost always seen in his trademark tweed jacket and a skinny red tie.
